# Project Overview
Our final project is a continuation of our housing app developed in project 3, where we had created a  website that functions as way for people to analyse the housing market within 5 cities within the GTA: <br>
1.Burlington <br>
2.Oakville <br>
3.Milton <br>
4.Vaughan <br>
5.Oshawa <br>

Using our web scraper to gather more data, we have created two machine learning models based on housing prices and whether or not the price listed for the house is undervalued or overvalued for the area and type of house (sq ft, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc). We have developed more charts and visuals to do comparisons for housing, especially when it comes to affordable housing. Looking at what areas and communities have how many “affordable houses” listed for sale compared to the provincial average income with analysis done on the areas. We also have updated the app more, including more buttons, menus, and directions to pages. We have added a feature for users in the website, to be able to input their household income and down payment in order to better target houses that may meet their affordability standards of no more than 35 percent of income spent on housing.
